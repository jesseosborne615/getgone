    <div class="words"
    <p1>I was thinking that maybe one day soon<br>If you ain't got that much to do<br>
        You might like to lay down with me<br>Kiss goodnight and go to sleep<br>
        Then wake up in the morning smiling wide<br>We'll hold hands and hold them tight<br>
        If you ain't got that much to do<br>Maybe I could be there too<br><br>
        In all my sweetest dreams<br>In these lovely fantasies<br>
        You are always by my side<br>And we don't have to say goodbye<br>
        A hundred thousand times ago<br>I told you I don't wanna go<br>
        Another day without you<br>I just wanna be there too<br><br>
        If you need to be alone<br>Say the word and I'll get gone<br>Not too far but just not there<br>
        Still in your heart and everywhere<br>When I'm back we'll be so close<br>
        There's nowhere else I'd rather go<br>Cause in my arms and in my songs<br>
        Is right where you belong<br><br>
        In all my sweetest dreams<br>In these lovely fantasies<br>
        You are always by my side<br>And we don't have to say goodbye<br>
        A hundred thousand times ago<br>I told you I don't wanna go<br>
        Another day without you<br>I just wanna be there too<br><br>
        I just wanna be with you
